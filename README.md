# Translating MPRAGE images to synthetic MP2RAGE ones

## Overview
This is the code repository of the paper [MPRAGE to MP2RAGE UNI translation via generative adversarial network improves the automatic tissue and lesion segmentation in multiple sclerosis patients](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104297). The code is implemented as a Google colab notebook. It can run directly on the browser of any computer using the GPU that colab provides for free. To do so the dataset needs to be uploaded in a folder of Google drive's user.

## Usage
Update the paths of synMP2RAGE_notebook.ipynb with your own and run the cells of the notebook. Comments are provided to clarify the main steps.
