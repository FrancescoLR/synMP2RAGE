# Translating MPRAGE images to synthetic MP2RAGE ones

This is the code repository of the paper [MPRAGE to MP2RAGE UNI translation via generative adversarial network improves the automatic tissue and lesion segmentation in multiple sclerosis patients](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104297). The code is implemented as a Google colab notebook. It can run directly on the browser using the GPU colab provides for free. The dataset needs to be uploaded in a folder in Google drive.
